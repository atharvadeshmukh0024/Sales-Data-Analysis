# Sales-Data-AnalysisProject Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data using machine learning techniques in Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to uncover patterns, predict future sales, and generate actionable insights that can improve business performance.

Key Objectives
Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and anomalies.
Sales Prediction: Use ML models to forecast future sales.
Customer Segmentation: Identify customer groups based on purchasing behavior.
Product Insights: Analyze product performance and optimize inventory levels.
Key Components
Data Collection:

Import sales data (e.g., CSV, database).
Common fields: transaction ID, product, quantity, price, date, customer ID, location.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing or inconsistent data.
Perform feature engineering (e.g., sales per transaction, revenue by category).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Use libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize:
Sales trends over time.
Top-performing products.
Regional sales distribution.
Machine Learning Models:

Regression Analysis:
Predict future sales using models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
Clustering:
Perform customer segmentation using K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering.
Classification:
Identify factors contributing to high or low sales using Logistic Regression or Decision Trees.
Evaluation Metrics:

For regression: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² score.
For clustering: Silhouette score, Within-cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS).
Implementation Steps
Load Data:
Import libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn).
Load data into a pandas DataFrame.
Preprocess Data:
Clean and transform data.
Create time-based features (e.g., month, weekday).
Build ML Models:
Train-test split the data.
Train models and optimize hyperparameters.
Evaluate performance using cross-validation.
Interpret Results:
Visualize predictions vs. actual sales.
Present key customer segments or product insights.
